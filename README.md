### **Einstein-in-a-Box**

Welcome to **Einstein-in-a-Box**, an automated iterative physics equation refinement tool that aims to push the boundaries of theoretical physics. Through this script, an equation is sent to an AI for feedback, improved upon, and updated in a GitHub repository. Over multiple iterations, the equation evolvesâ€”perhaps leading to a Nobel-worthy discovery!

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Initialization**:
   - The script reads the current equation from a file (`equation.txt`).
   - If `equation.txt` is empty, you're prompted to provide an initial equation.

2. **AI Feedback Loop**:
   - The equation is sent to the AI, which provides critical feedback.
   - Based on the feedback, the AI refines the equation to make it more novel and innovative.
   - This improved equation is saved back to `equation.txt`.

3. **GitHub Update**:
   - After each iteration, the updated equation is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository automatically.

4. **Repeat**:
   - The loop runs for the number of iterations specified by the user.
   - Each cycle leads to a progressively refined equation.

### **Getting Started**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/einstein-in-a-box.git
cd einstein-in-a-box
```

#### **2. Set Up Your Environment**

- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install required libraries (e.g., `openai`):
  
```bash
pip install openai
```

#### **3. Configure API Key**

You'll need an OpenAI API key. Checkout OpenAI's documentation on how to do this in case you don't know how to.

DO NOT HARDCODE THE KEY, IT WILL LEAK IF YOU DO SO. If you are going to hardcode the key, make sure to remove the auto github push functionality to it - or do it in a private repository.

#### **4. Run the Script**

Simply execute the script:

```bash
python einstein_in_a_box.py
```

#### **5. Enter the Number of Iterations**

The script will prompt you to enter the number of iterations (loops) you'd like the equation to go through.

### **Usage Example**

1. **Initial Equation**:
   When you run the script for the first time, it will read the equation from `equation.txt`. If the file is empty, you'll be asked to input an equation manually.

2. **Iterate**:
   The AI will improve the equation, update `equation.txt`, and push the changes to your GitHub repo after each loop.

### **Disclaimer**

This script is a fun, experimental project! The equations produced may not be scientifically valid and should be treated as such unless verified by a physicist.

Now, fire up the loop and start refining those equations. Who knows? You might just create the next revolutionary formula! ðŸ˜Š
